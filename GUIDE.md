### GUIDE
Download and launch the executable.

#### Header
- The "Switch Curve Type" button switches the application between creating vertical curves and horizontal curves. 
- The icon directly to the right of the "Switch Curve Type" button is a file selection dialog. If you decide to export your curve into a text file or pdf file, it will show up with the specified name given in the dialog box. 
- To export the data from the right column, press the ".txt" or ".pdf" button.

#### Left Column
- The left column is split between "Inputs" and "Additional Details".

- All the input boxes under "Inputs" are required to be filled out to create a curve.
- The "S" button changes the input station from PVI, PVT, or PVC. (Horizontal curves are PI, PT, PC)
- Under horizontal curves, the Cycle button next to the "S" button changes the input method.

- All the input boxes under "Additional Details" are optional and are not required to form a curve.
- The "A" button changes the agency for which the curve is tested against.
- The Cycle button next to the "A" button changes the type of test done.

- According to the Caltrans HDM, "The stopping sight distances.. should be increased by 20 percent on sustained downgrades steeper than 3 percent and longer than one mile." If this is the case, checkmark the "Sustained Downgrade" checkbox.

- Under vertical curves, the Arrow button dictates the type of obstacle. The arrow pointing upwards means the curve is compliant only if it travels below the obstacle elevation at the given station. The arrow pointing downwards means the curve is compliant only if it travels above the obstacle elevation at the given station.
    Ex. Arrow pointing upwards is a bridge overhead. Arrow pointing downwards is a underground pipe. 
- The "+" button adds an obstacle with the details given.
- The "-" button removes the latest obstacle.

#### Right Column
- The right column is all the details pertaining to the curve.
- The checkmark icon under Curve Length and Obstacle Validation mean the curve is compliant with the given restriction.
- The exclamation icon means the curve is not compliant with the given restriction.
- Interval stations are limited to 100 print-outs.
